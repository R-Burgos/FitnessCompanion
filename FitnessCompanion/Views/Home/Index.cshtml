                <p>My instructor, Jeremy, gave me some really good advice on creating the console app version of what I wanted to ultimately make. This greatly helped me structure my final project.</p>

                <p>After a few trials, I had my project up and running. Until this point, I had spent most of my time working on the back-end, which is obvious when looking at the original styling.</p>

                <p>I spent a ridiculous amount of time getting a carousel to work. While I ended up scrapping this for the final, this provided a great learning opportunity.</p>

            <blockquote>“If you accomplish something good with hard work, the labor passes quickly,
            but the good endures; if you do something shameful in pursuit of pleasure, the pleasure
            passes quickly, but the shame endures” — Musonius Rufus</blockquote>
